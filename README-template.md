## Development Process

### Built With

The project was built using the following technologies and techniques:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout
- Mobile-first approach for responsive design



### Key Learnings

While working on this project, I gained valuable experience and knowledge in the following areas:
- Implementing responsive design using media queries and CSS Grid
- Applying hover and focus states to interactive elements using CSS
- Utilizing styled components for modular and maintainable styling
- Incorporating a mobile-first workflow for efficient development

Here's an example of some code I'm proud of:

```css
.button:hover {
  background-color: #ff5500;
  color: #ffffff;
}

This CSS snippet demonstrates the hover state style for a button.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on the following areas:

    Enhancing accessibility features for better user experience
    Exploring advanced animation techniques to bring interactivity to components
    Improving performance through optimized code and asset management
